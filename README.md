# Face-Recognition-with-Live-Attendance
I have made this project on pycharm if you dont hava it you can also run this project smoothly on VScode. After importing the code you have to download various dependency to run the code. The dependency are like CV2 , numpy , Face_recognition , os , datetime . After that you can directly run the AttendanceProject.py file
